## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd PMS
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the server directory:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pms
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
EMAIL_USER=mdashifreza7869101@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=737uydyus@1
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the client directory:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 4. Database Setup

Run the database seeder to create default admin user and sample data:

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

This will create:
- Admin user: `admin@pms.com` / `admin123`
- Member user: `john@pms.com` / `member123`
- Sample project with cards and notifications

### 5. Start the Application

#### Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd server
npm run dev:env
```

#### Start the Frontend (in a new terminal)
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000
